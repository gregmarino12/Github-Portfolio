### Education & Experience

#### Oxbridge Academy of The Palm Beaches, FL May 2020   


<I> Undergraduate at University of Denver, Daniels College Of Business, Fall 2020 - June 2024</i>
<br> Major: Bachelor of Business Information & Analytics & Management 
<br>
<br>I moved to DU as a freshman in September 2020, marking my first-ever visit to the campus. I've been told it's quite rare to attend a college without having seen it in person beforehand. Since then, I've become deeply grateful for the community of peers I've built, people I know I can rely on for the rest of my life. During my time here, I discovered my passion for analytical work within businesses. I love the idea of being a problem solver across various industries, and this undergraduate major has helped me refine my specific interests in this field.

#### <i> Internship with Ceruity, Summer 2023 & Winter 2023</i>

My clear passion for finance truly shined through my Junior year summer when I entered my first internship within the wealth management firm, Certuity, in North Palm Beach, Florida. This opportunity allowed me to dive into the specific industry where I could use the skills I have learned throughout my undergraduate studies. They were shocked by my enthusiasm to become familiar with everything I could and my love for helping everyone. 

This experience led to an invitation to return and work over winter break. During that time, I was more hands-on with both the material and the clients, demonstrating the increased trust the company had in me. This made me extremely proud of my work and grateful for the opportunity. I wanted to show my appreciation by working as hard as I possibly could. Eventually, this dedication resulted in an offer to return to Certuity in June after completing my undergraduate degree at the University of Denver.

#### About

#### Joining the Lambda Chi Alpha Community, Fall 2020 - Spring 2024

In my time being involved inside of the fraternity, I have been engaged on the social board, helping plan events, and rituals that we take part in to properly initiate our incoming brothers. This opportunity has taught me a lot of communication and interpersonal skills that have been reflected in my undergraduate experience. It has allowed me to reflect on my ability to be a leader inside of a program and even ways how I can improve my management skills.
