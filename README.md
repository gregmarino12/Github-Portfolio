### Joining a Fraternity community 
<i>Fall 2020 - Spring 2024</i>
<br>
<br>
<be> As an incoming freshman during the year of COVID-19, I found it hard to meet new people with only 60% of the students actually on campus. Many chose the remote class route, which added to this difficult period of my career at DU. By properly immersing myself into the community, I was able to find a great group of similar valued individuals who were also in the same boat that I was. 
<br>
<br> In my time being involved inside of the fraternity I have been involved on the social board, helping plan events, and rituals that we take part in to properly initiate our incoming brothers. This opportunity has taught me a lot of communication and interpersonal skills that have been reflected in my undergraduate experience. It has allowed me to reflect on my ability to be a leader inside of a program, and even ways on how I can improve my management skills.
<br>
<be> The opportunities that I have received and the events that I have been able to successfully facilitate have been a huge part of my both personal and social competence inside of our community here at DU.

### Education & Experience
<i>Undergraduate at University of Denver, Fall 2019 - Winter 2022</i>
<br>
<br>I came to DU for my first time ever as a freshman while moving in September 2020. From what I have heard, it is extremely unusual to attend a college that you have never visited before. Since then I am extremely greatful for the community of peers that I have built and can count on for the rest of my life. I also found  my passion of analytical use inside of businesses. I loved the idea of being a problem solver inside of a plethora of industries and truly finalized my specific interests within this undergraduate major. 

<i> Internship with Ceruity, Summer 2023 & Winter 2023</i>
<br>
<br> One of these passions that I have realized is my high interest in our countries economy. My clear passion for finance truly shined through my Junior year summer when I landed my first internship opportunity within the wealth management firm, Certuity, in North Palm Beach, Florida. This opportunity allowed me to dive into the specific industry in which I could use the skills I have learned throughout my undergraduate. They were shocked with my enthusiasm to become familiar with everything I possibly could and my love for helping everyone. 

<br> This led to them asking me back to work over winter break. Over the winter break, I was a lot more hands on with the material and even clients, showing the growth in trust that the company had in me. This made me extremely proud of my work and greatful for the opportunity at hand, and made me want to show them how excited I was by working as hard as I possibly could. This eventually led to them asking me to return in June after I finish my undergraduate degrees at the University of Denver.
