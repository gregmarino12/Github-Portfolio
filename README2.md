### Work Examples
#### <i>In Class Projects
Enterprise OLTP Database Project

During my Enterprise Information Management class in the Spring Quarter of 2023, I was tasked with the planning, designing, developing, and programming aspects of an information management system using Microsoft Word (documentation), Visio (diagraming), and Visual Studio (database). This required a lot of deep thought about how a specific kind of business could benefit using our analytical skills. I decided it would be interesting to try and use my father's company's structure with mock data. (I also completed the same design using his real data, but that only went to him for disclosure reasons.

I enjoyed the creation of this database because by reflecting on it now, I have realized how much that class forced me to become a stronger developer and analyst. Our professor oriented the class in a way that you had to go out and figure out most of this information on your own, so I feel that it pushed me to become a better student and individual overall. This class was also my highest grade ever in my DU career (100.04%).

One of my favorite accomplishments was when I found a way for my father to accept cryptocurrency for his used exotic car dealership. I was able to network with an individual from California who worked at one of the first banks to instantly liquidate high volumes of cryptocurrency for a very small fee. This essentially mitigated my father's exposure to these high-volatility assets. I am extremely proud of this accomplishment because it is still being used to this day.

### FUN!


Growing up in Jupiter, FL I have always loved doing absolutely anything on the water. Whether that is fishing, scuba diving, snorkeling, etc. it has always been a part of my life and how I relieve stress.

Here is a picture of me right after grabbing a starfish in our Jupiter inlet.
